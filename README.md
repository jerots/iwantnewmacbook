### Things to look into
+ **CSSFrameworks** - Pre-packaged CSS stylesheets that we can use to quickly create UI elements
  + http://getbootstrap.com/components/
  + I used http://materializecss.com
  + Copy and paste elements from their docs, *rarely* need to type ourselves.
  + Learn the grid system http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid

+ **JQuery** - A must have. Makes it much easier to manipulate DOM
  + Selecting html nodes https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
  + Attaching event handlers https://api.jquery.com/on/
  + Modifying html: `.html()` `.val()` `.addClass()`

+ **Templating Engine** - Generate html based on a template + data you define (remember the pain of printing manually in PHP?)
  + http://handlebarsjs.com

+ **LocalStorage** - can use this instead of DB if you wanna make things simple first
  + `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`
  
+ **Other extra features** - just to learn how to use 3rd party APIs
  + Expenses breakdown chart http://www.chartjs.org
  + Export to PDF
